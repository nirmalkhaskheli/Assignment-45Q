//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
//print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
// with the person’s name.





var friendNames:string[]=["Areeba","Mariya","Alina","Fozia"];


console.log(`hello ${friendNames[0]},Whatsup dear?`);
console.log(`hello ${friendNames[1]},Whatsup dear?`);
console.log(`hello ${friendNames[2]},Whatsup dear?`);
console.log(`hello ${friendNames[3]},Whatsup dear?`);
